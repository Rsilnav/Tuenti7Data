This repository contains a snapshot of the webpage that contained the ranking EVERY minute from the start to the end of the contest.
Data can be used for any supa dupa stats you want to build, as I'd appreaciate some recognition for gathering it when used.

## What is Tuenti Challenge?

**From the official webpage:**
*Tuenti Challenge is a contest that consists of some typical programming challenges, and other challenges that don’t include any hints and can be quite tricky, so you’ll really have to give your brain a workout! You can choose the programming language or technique you prefer for each challenge. And remember that it’s not a speed competition, so the quality of your solutions, code, and algorithms really matter!*
